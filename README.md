# IntelliJ IDEA mouse-less kata

## Overview
IntelliJ IDEA is a keyboard-centric IDE. Most of the actions (navigation,
refactoring, debugging, etc.) can be carried out without using a mouse, 
which lets dramatically increase coding speed.

This project will familiarize you with the most commonly used features and
speed up your development while both of your hands are lying comfortable on 
the keyboard.

## Where should I start?
Go to the test classes and select the division you'd like to master. Follow each
test case one by one carefully reading the comments.
